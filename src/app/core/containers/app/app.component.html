  <p>This is a simple piece of javascript (licensed under the MIT license) by
    <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/arpruss/">Alexander Pruss</a> that splits an STL mesh file that contains
    multiple
    parts into
    those multiple parts.
  </p>
  <p>This may well fail if the mesh is defective and has points that are meant to be coincident
    but are merely close together.</p>
  <p>All the processing is done in your browser--your STL is not uploaded to any server.</p>
  <p><b>Warning:</b> If an object has a cavity surrounded by material on all sides, you will get one mesh for the outer
    surface
    and an inside-out mesh for the cavity. Solving this problem would require significant coding.</p>
